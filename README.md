I heard about programming and coding first 
around 2014, I saw it as something that will
benefit me, so I strted with Java.
But I was discouraged by people around me 
who didn't know what it was.
 They told me to hustle and make money
and not waste my time in front of computers.

My biggest regret was listening to them then.
But this is me in 2022 trying to start afresh
but now with Javascript and Python.
Your good advice is highly welcome.
